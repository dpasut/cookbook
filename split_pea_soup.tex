\freeform From 101 Cookbooks.

\Ing{1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil}
\Ing{2 large onions, chopped}
\Ing{\nicefrac{1}{2} teaspoon fine-grain sea salt}
\Ing{2 cups dried split green peas, picked over and rinsed}
\Ing{5 cups water or vegetable broth}
\Ing{juice of 1/2 lemon (reserve the zest)\\}
\Ing{a few pinches of smoked paprika}
\Ing{more olive oil to drizzle}

Add olive oil to a big pot over med-high heat. Stir in onions and salt and cook until the onions soften, just a minute or two. Add the split peas and water. Bring to a boil, dial down the heat, and simmer for 20 minutes, or until the peas are cooked through (but still a touch al dente). Using a large cup or mug ladle half of the soup into a bowl and set aside. Using a hand blender (or regular blender) puree the soup that is still remaining in the pot. Stir the reserved (still chunky) soup back into the puree - you should have a soup that is nicely textured. If you need to thin the soup out with more water (or stock) do so a bit at a time. Stir in the lemon juice and taste. If the soup needs more salt, add more a bit at a time until the flavor of the soup really pops.\\

Ladle into bowls or cups, and serve each drizzled with olive oil and topped with a good pinch of smoked paprika and a touch of lemon zest.
