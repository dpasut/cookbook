\begin{recipe}{Ricotta}{unknown}{}


    \Ing{1\nicefrac{1}{2} liters full fat milk}
    \Ing{1\nicefrac{1}{2}-2 tbsp lemon juice or vinegar}

    Bring milk to $170\degree$F in a heavy bottom pot. When the milk comes to temperature, pour lemon juice or vinegar. Then gently stir the milk. Immediately you can see the entire milk begins to curdle. Turn off the flame. At this stage if your milk doesn't curdle, pour some more lemon juice immediately to curdle the milk.\\

    Allow it to settle for 1 min and pour it in a thin cheese cloth lined over a colander. Let sit for 10 minutes.\\

    Store in your fridge for up to 1 week.\\

    \textbf{Notes:}\\

    The resulting liquid, whey, is great for baking bread! Use it instead of water for a more flavourful, chewier bread (see p. \pageref{bread:noknead}, p. \pageref{bread:focaccia},p. \pageref{components:pizza_dough}).\\

    Try adding some heavy cream to the milk! It'll lead to a creamier texture.
