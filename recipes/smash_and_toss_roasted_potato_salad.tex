\freeform From 101 Cookbooks.

\Ing{1 pound small potatoes, smaller is better}
\Ing{1 \nicefrac{1}{2} cups cooked lentils, room temperature}
\Ing{3 tbsp chopped sun-dried tomatoes (oil packed)}
\Ing{2 tbsp oil from sun-dried tomato jar}
\Ing{1 tbsp pickled sushi ginger (optional)}
\Ing{\nicefrac{1}{2} tsp fine grain sea salt}
\Ing{2 cloves garlic, smashed and chopped}
\Ing{5 scallions, chopped}
\Ing{Juice of half a lemon, or to taste\\}
\Ing{\nicefrac{1}{3} cup toasted, sliced almonds}
\Ing{a handful of basil, slivered}

Heat oven to 425F. Rinse the potatoes, and pat dry with a clean dish towel, absorbing as much extra water as possible. Place the potatoes on a baking sheet and sprinkle with a bit of salt. Roast until well-cooked through - you want them to be fully cooked, fluffy and tender. Remove from the oven, wait five minutes, take a fork, and press about half of the potatoes. You want to smash the potatoes, while still having them retain some structure.\\

In a large bowl, toss the lentils with the sun-dried tomatoes, sun-dried tomato oil, ginger, sea salt, garlic, most of the scallions, and lemon juice. Toss well. Add the potatoes and gently toss again. Top with the remaining scallions, the almonds, and basil.
