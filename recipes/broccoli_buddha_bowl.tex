\freeform From 101 Cookbooks.

\Ing{3 cups cooked quinoa}
\Ing{5 cups raw broccoli, cut into small florets and stems}
\Ing{1 tbsp green curry paste}
\Ing{2 medium garlic cloves}
\Ing{\nicefrac{2}{3} cup sliced or slivered almonds, toasted }
\Ing{2 big pinches salt}
\Ing{2 tbsp fresh lemon juice}
\Ing{\nicefrac{1}{2} cup full-fat coconut milk\\}
\Ing{Optional toppings: microgreens, hot sauce, sliced avocado}

Heat the quinoa and set aside.\\

Cook the broccoli by pouring 3/4 cup water into a large pot and bringing it to a simmer. Add a big pinch of salt and stir in the broccoli. Cover and cook for a minute, just long enough to take the raw edge off. Transfer the broccoli to a strainer and run under cold water until it stops cooking. Set aside.\\

To make the broccoli pesto puree two cups of the cooked broccoli, curry paste, garlic, 1/2 cup of the almonds, salt, lemon juice, and coconut milk in a food processor. Pulse until smooth.\\

Just before serving, toss the quinoa and remaining broccoli florets with about 1/2 of the broccoli pesto. Taste and adjust if needed, you might want to add more of the pesto a bit at a time, or you might want a bit more salt or an added squeeze of lemon juice. Turn out onto a serving platter and top with the remaining almonds, and any other toppings you like - some slices avocado, greens or sprouts, and/or hot sauce are all good fits.
