\freeform From 101 Cookbooks.

\Ing{butter}
\Ing{2 \nicefrac{1}{2} cups cooked quinoa, at room temperature}
\Ing{4 large eggs, beaten}
\Ing{scant \nicefrac{1}{2} tsp fine grain sea salt}
\Ing{1 small onion, finely chopped}
\Ing{\nicefrac{1}{2} cup crumbled feta}
\Ing{1 clove garlic, minced}
\Ing{1 cup very finely chopped kale}
\Ing{\nicefrac{1}{2} cup shelled edamame}
\Ing{\nicefrac{3}{4} cup breadcrumbs}

Preheat oven to 375F, with a rack in the top third.\\

Butter mini-muffin tins generously, and line with a strip of parchment paper in each indent, this makes popping the bites out of the pan after either baking or freezing simple.\\

Combine the quinoa, eggs, and salt in a medium bowl. Stir in the onion, feta, garlic, kale, and edamame. Stir in most of the breadcrumbs, and let sit for a few minutes so the breadcrumbs can absorb some of the moisture. Fill the prepared muffin tins with the quinoa mixture, pressing the mixture down, and then sprinkling with the remaining breadcrumbs. Bake for 25-30 minutes or until baked through and deeply golden crusted.\\

Remove the quinoa bites from the pans after a few minutes. Enjoy either hot, or at room temperature.
