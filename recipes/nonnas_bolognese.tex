    This recipe is an attempt at recreating my Nonna's meat sauce. Its pretty darn close.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Use olive oil to coat pan
        \item Dice onion and shred carrot, add to pan on medium heat
        \item Finely chop parsley, basil and dill, add to pot once onion starts to brown (after about 5 minutes)
        \item Raise temperature to med-high, add water and ground beef, breaking the meat into very small pieces as it cooks
        \item Once meat is cooked and water has evaporated, add bouillon, pepper, cinnamon, nutmeg, Mrs. Dash, pepper flakes and tomato paste.
        \item Stir continually until the tomato paste starts to stick to the bottom of the pan, add the white wine to deglaze the pan.
        \item add jar of crushed tomatoes
        \item lower heat to low, cover, stirring ever 15 minutes
        \item let cook for between $1\nicefrac{1}{2}$ and $2$ hours
        \item Salt to taste
    \end{itemize}
