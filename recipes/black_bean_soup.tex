\Ing{1 medium-size green bell pepper, chopped}
\Ing{4 garlic cloves, minced}

\Ing{1 16-ounce package dried black beans}
\Ing{1 tablespoon chopped chipotle chiles from a can (this gives it a solid kick, dial back if you are wary)}

\Ing{2 tablespoons fresh lime juice}
\Ing{2 teaspoons coarse kosher salt}
\Ing{\nicefrac{1}{4} teaspoon ground black pepper\\}
\Ing{\textbf{Crema}}
\Ing{1 tablespoon whole cumin seeds}
\Ing{1 cup crema or crème fraîche (or swap sour cream or yogurt, for a close-enough taste)}
\Ing{Salt and freshly ground pepper}

\textbf{Black Bean Soup}

Heat olive oil in large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onions and both bell peppers and sauté until beginning to brown, about eight minutes. Add garlic and cumin; stir one minute. Transfer mixture to 6-quart slow cooker. Add beans and chipotles, then 7 cups hot water. Cover and cook on high until beans are very tender, about 3 hours (or longer if they are not ready).\\

Transfer two cups bean mixture to blender; puree until smooth. Return puree to remaining soup in slow cooker. Stir in lime juice, salt, and pepper. Adjust seasonings to taste; we found we needed more salt. Ladle soup into bowls. Spoon dollop of toasted cumin seed cream (below) over each bowl and serve.\\

This soup keeps great in the fridge, and even thickens a bit. In a good way!\\

\textbf{Toasted Cumin Seed Crema}

Place the cumin in a small sauté pan over medium heat. Toast until lightly golden brown. Place in spice grinder or mortar and pestle and grind until coarse. Stir it into the creme and season with salt and pepper, to taste.
