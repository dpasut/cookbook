    \freeform From Adam Ragusea Pancakes 101.

    \Ing{2 tbsp (28g) butter}
    \Ing{2 tbsp (25g) sugar}
    \Ing{1 egg}
    \Ing{2 tsp (5 ml) vanilla}
    \Ing{$1\nicefrac{3}{4}$ cups (400ml) milk}
    \Ing{1 tsp salt}
    \Ing{1 heaped tbsp (16 g) baking powder}
    \Ing{$1\nicefrac{1}{2}-2\nicefrac{1}{2}$ cups (200-300g) flour}


    Melt the butter without getting it too hot, mix in the sugar, then beat the egg in thoroughly. Mix in the vanilla, milk, salt and baking powder/soda. Start mixing in a conservative amount of flour, then keep mixing until you get the thickness you want. The thicker the batter, the thicker the pancake. Be sure to not over-mix â€” the batter should be full of small lumps. Let the batter rest a few minutes while you heat up your pan.\\

    Heat your cooking surface of choice (I use nonstick) to a low-moderate heat and smear it with butter. When the butter is just starting to brown, pour on the pancakes. When there are lots of bubbles on the surface, flip the pancakes and cooking until they look cooked, then cook them another minute before removing to a cooling rack.\\

    To keep them warm while the remaining batches cook, set your oven to $170\degree$F and place cooling rack in the oven.
