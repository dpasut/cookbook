    \Ing{Pork Shoulder}
    \Ing{Kosher Salt}
    \Ing{Pink Curing Salt}
    \Ing{Whole Cloves}

    This curing method uses \emph{equilibrium curing}, and it is expedited by the use of your refrigerator.\\

    \textbf{Cure}\\
    The cure is created by combining 1 part curing salt and 5 parts kosher salt. This will be used as a 0.5\% curing salt by weight/2.5\% salt by weight cure when applied to the pork.\\

    Cut your pork shoulder into 100-200g pieces. Weigh each piece, multiply that weight by 0.03-0.04 to get the weight of the pre-mixed cure that must be added to each piece. Once the cure is weighed out and applied to each piece evenly on all sides with none remaining, vacuum seal them individually for 5-7 days.\\

    \textbf{Drying}\\
    Once cured for 5-7 days, remove from the vacuum bags and pat dry. Press cloves into the exterior and wrap in cheese cloth. Weigh and record current weight. Tie string around them and hang in your refrigerator, they are done drying when they have lost 35\% of their weight (ie. if current weight is 147g, it will be done when it reaches 95g.). This process should take 2-4 weeks. Check on them often.\\

    \textbf{Storage}\\
    Remove cheese cloth and vacuum seal for long term storage in your refrigerator.
